# walkability_score


# Objective of the Analysis
This analysis is intended to provide a generalized score of a city in comparison to other cities, all within the limits of the OSM API and the use of Nasa population data. The score achieved in this notebook must be taken and validated with other studies and reviewed with local universities at these locations for better judgment. The study is a starting point for anybody wishing to understand a city in more detail using only freely available data sources and reusable code.
